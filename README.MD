## ROM Files Instructions

**ROMs are not included!** In order to use this arcade core, you will need to provide the correct ROM file yourself.

To simplify the process .mra files are provided in the releases folder, that specify the required ROMs with their checksums. The ROMs .zip filename refers to the
corresponding file from the MAME project.

Please refer to https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/Arcade-Roms for information on how to setup and use the environment.
